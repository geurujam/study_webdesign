        <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his profession:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in what a designer can do with the individual letters</p>
            
            <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in the interpretation</p>
